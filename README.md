# ProjectEuler_1-100_in_Go
My solutions for Project Euler challenges from 1 - 100.  As a Go language learning exercise

Most of the solutions solve the problem from beginning to end.
In a few cases I partly solved the problem in my head so the starting point for the code may not be totally obvious.
In a at least one case I ran the code several times with different ranges of numbers before finding the solution.  As a result the inputs may seem arbitrary.
