# ProjectEuler_1-100_in_Go
My solutions for Project Euler challenges from 1 - 100.  As a Go language learning exercise

Most of the solutions solve the problem from beginning to end.
In a few cases I partly solved the problem in my head so the starting point for the code may not be totally obvious.
In a at least one case I ran the code several times with different ranges of numbers before finding the solution.  As a result the inputs may seem arbitrary.

All the solutions are written as a single Go package.  You will need to edit main.go in order to run the correct solution.

In many cases, solutions call functions that were part of a previous solution.  I should move these out into a separate file but I've not got around to that yet.
