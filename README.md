# ProjectEuler_1-100_in_Go
My solutions for Project Euler challenges from 1 - 100.  As a Go language learning exercise

Most of the solutions solve the problem from beginning to end.
In a few cases I partly solved the problem in my head so the starting point for the code may not be totally obvious.
In a at least one case I ran the code several times with different ranges of numbers before finding the solution.  As a result the inputs may seem arbitrary.

You will need to edit main.go in order to run the correct solution.

In most cases code which is common between challenge has been put in a separate "shared" package.
